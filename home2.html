    <b><u><h1>ABOUT</h1></u></b>
    <b><u><h1>   ME</h1></u></b>
    <p>I am Malshi Sathsarani Jayakodi. I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering from IJSE(Institute Of Java Software Engineer). Born on 27th April 2001, Ragama is my hometown and holds a special place in my heart.

        I am a friendly person. I have a natural inclination towards competition because I believe it drives me to strive for excellence and reach my full potential.

        I appreciate the moments of solitude. Reading books is one of my favorite pastimes, and I find solace in the knowledge and insight they provide.

        Besides books, my other passion is spending time with my pet dogs. Their unconditional love and companionship brings immense joy to my life.

        In my journey as a software engineering student, I am constantly honing my skills and exploring new technologies. My passion is to contribute to the ever-evolving technology industry and make a positive impact through innovative solutions.

        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to connecting with like-minded people who share my passion for the wonders of software engineering and literature.</p>
