        I am Malshi Satsarani Jayakodi. I am currently pursuing a software engineering degree from IJSE (Institute Of Java Software Engineer). Born on 27th April 2001, Ragama is my hometown.

        I have a natural inclination towards competition as I believe it motivates me to strive for excellence and reach my full potential.

        Reading books is one of my favorite pastimes and I find solace in the knowledge and insight they provide. Besides books, my other passion is spending time with my pet dogs. Their boundless love and companionship brings immense happiness to my life.

        In my journey as a software engineering student, I am constantly honing my skills and exploring new technologies.
